# MimicPatchTo
MimicPatchTo will copy a existing patch then append it to any given target patch to a specific x, y coordinate. *Note* Keep patches small for faster results.

This is the firs quality of life tools I created. Initally I created this tool to debug pd patches then quickly relized I accidently made something more usefull attainable And had a much smaller scope. More imporant I was able to complete it. :)

*NOTE* - Works great but tends to slow down when copying big patches.

No externals used. Should be fine for vanilla Puredata. Wrtten with Pd 51.4
